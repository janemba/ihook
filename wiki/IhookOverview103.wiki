All the tests was made with Visual Studio express 2010.


= Compiling ihook with Visual Studio =

Some steps is required in order to compile ihook project with Visual Studio. First of all the latest sources must be downloaded. Once done, open Visual Studio and create a new project as _Win32 Project_, click _next_, select _Static library_ and unselect _Precompiled header_.

Next add the following files to the project:
 * hookit.c
 * hookit.h
 * BeaEngine.c (from ...\dep\beaengine\beaengineSources\BeaEngine.c)

To finish, _BeaEngine_ header must be added:
 * Go to project properties -> _Configuration Properties_ -> _C/C++_ -> _General_
 * Select _Additional Include Directories_ -> _edit_ and add the following directory:
    * _...\dep\beaengine\include_

Now, for the last step some directive for the preprocessor must be added:
 * Go to project properties -> _Configuration Properties_ -> _C/C++_ -> _Preprocessor_
 * Select _Preprocessor Definitions_ -> _edit_ and add the following constant (one per line):
    * _IHOOK_CALL_STDCALL_
    * _IHOOK_ENGINE_LIB
    * _BEA_ENGINE_STATIC_

And voil√† ! The project is ready to compile but you will get a lot of warning due to the use of _strcpy_ function. Don't worry :)
